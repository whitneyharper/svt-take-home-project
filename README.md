## Overview

### The challenge

There is an API that will return a list of robots, as well as their battery level and x,y coordinates in a warehouse. Using this API, we need to display all of these robots in a webpage. The technologies you choose are largely up to you.

### Features

- Display a table with all robots.
- Filter/Search for a robot by it's Id.
- Sort robots attributes by ascending or descending order.

## Getting Started

### Built with
- React.js
- Bootstrap 
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### Dependencies
- Axios
- Bootstrap Icons

### Before Installing
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is needed.
* Also [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is needed.

### Installing

* Clone repository git clone 

```
https://github.com/whitneyharper/svt-take-home-project.git
```

* To install dependencies type [npm install] in the terminal 

```
npm install
```

### Executing program

* In the project directory, you can run the app type [npm start] in the terminal.

```
npm start
```
## Prospective Ideas
- Expand filter/search functionality to include other attributes along with robotId.
- Table is quite long, I would like to implement a pagination. 
- Add a dropdown with options for the user to choice the number of rows of data to    display in the table.
